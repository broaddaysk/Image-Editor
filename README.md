# Image Editor

An image editor that blurs/outlines ppm images. Gui created with fltk.

The purpose of this project was to practice gui programming, github project management, basic optimization, and OOP design.

    GUI-reading/using fltk documentation
    GITHUB-learning how to present a project (potentially as part of a portfolio)
    OPTIMIZING-profiling with Visual Studio, efficient memory management
    OOP-using separate header/source structure, managing scope during the design process

Notes: blur/outline algorithms were designed by myself and are the main bottlenecks during runtime (besides for writeFile). In the future, use existing implementations or memcopy()/copy() at least
